      <p class="paragraph">I was part of working on this project in 2016, during KEA Digital Concept Development education, having <a href="https://a-r-c.dk" target="_blank" class="link-design">Amager Resource Center (ARC)</a> as a client. The solution was created for the ARC visitors center.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Background</strong><br><br>ARC is a waste disposal plant owned by 5 Copenhagen Municipalities. The primary operations revolve around waste management including collecting, sorting and recycling. ARC is unique in that it turns the waste it receives into energy, which is distributed back to Copenhagen. <br><br>Simultaneously ARC runs a Visitor Center that provides educational experiences for a variety of target groups and is focused on the environmental aspects of waste. At the time at which the project took place, the visitor center was planned to be moved into the current Amager Bakke/Copenslope plant designed by Architect Bjarke Ingels and used the colaboration with KEA to spring and gather ideas early on.</p>
      <div class="image-sizing"><img src="images/674cc737359853.573dadcac5a23.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" srcset="images/674cc737359853.573dadcac5a23-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/674cc737359853.573dadcac5a23-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/674cc737359853.573dadcac5a23-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/674cc737359853.573dadcac5a23.jpg 1920w" alt="" class="image-8"></div>
      <p class="paragraph">To fully appreciate and understand the problem aimed to be solved, the team of six - me along with five other colleagues from KEA - went two times to visit the power plant. ARC offers educations tours in which students get information about the plant&#x27;s activity and other topic as recycle and water management. We took part at one of these visits and observed.<br><br><br><span class="text-span-9">Insights</span>‍<br></p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="list-item-style">the communication was primarily one way; despite the ARC presenters best efforts to engage the young audience, only a few of the students actively participated in the Q &amp; A´s</li>
        <li class="list-item-style">the students were seated around classroom tables and their attention was easily diverted during the initial instruction video as well as in the following chemistry experiment and the concluding guided tour</li>
        <li class="list-item-style">the chemistry experiment and the sharing of results seemed chaotic while the amount of lab instruments were insufficient and not everyone got their chance to work</li>
        <li class="list-item-style">there was little team activity and some of the activities seem to be disconnected from the tour of the plant</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="image-sizing"><img src="images/812f7937359853.573dadcac5f75.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" srcset="images/812f7937359853.573dadcac5f75-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/812f7937359853.573dadcac5f75-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/812f7937359853.573dadcac5f75-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/812f7937359853.573dadcac5f75-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/812f7937359853.573dadcac5f75.jpg 1920w" alt="" class="image-9"></div>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Process</strong><br><br>All the ideas gathered formed a sum up of key points for each visit and offered an overview when looking for patterns, themes and commonality between attractions.<br><br>From the Insights gathered and analysed, it was concluded that interactivity is an essential component if an educational experience is to become memorable. With this in mind, the concept is focused on the visitor&#x27;s perspective and their entire experience - including reflection upon their visit.<br>‍<br>A user journey has been envisioned and mapped out, in order to define both the tangible and digital elements for the students. Trying to map out what activities or events could take place before and after the visit to the plant was essential for the overall journey.<br></p>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Main touch points</strong><br></p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="list-item-style">the journey started in the school clasroom, where the students and teachers receive introductory PDF’s and are able to register for the tour</li>
        <li class="list-item-style">in order for the students to better relate to waste management and their role in it, they are encouraged to bring with them one item at their own choice in order to learn about its characteristics</li>
        <li class="list-item-style">on return to school, they are encouraged to reflect by discussing their teamwork efforts and possibly revise areas where they could have performed better and about the new things they learned</li>
        <li class="list-item-style">post visit they will receive at school personalised 3D printed keepsakes (made of recycled plastic from the plant) which they designed whilst at the visitor center</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Concept</strong><br><br>The concepts main focus is to create a more immersive experience at the new visitor centre. From the research carried out, it was concluded that this is the place where visitors spend the most time and where most of the improvements could be accomplished. User experiences, both for digital and analogue solutions, were investigated and carefully analysed, discussed, evaluated and held against both the client goal and user engagement possibilites.<br>‍<br><br><strong>Solution</strong><br>‍<br>We prototyped an interactive solution that was based on an evaluation of all our insights, that would encompass all the elements that are required to make a visit at ARC more interactive, engaging, educational and memorable. Then we searched for technology that could best support our ideas.<br><br>Interactive round tables were able to fulfill the baseline requirements as they facilitate and enable team work, they can be scaled to work for different target groups and purposes. The flexibility allows ARC to create a myriad of different experiences, enable gamification and foster exploration.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Prototype</strong><br><br>A prototype was created to test the idea thoroughly, get the look and feel, and visualise the possibilities of the concept.<br> <br>The prototype consisted of having a projector mounted to the ceiling projecting animated presentations from above over a round table where test persons could gather around. The different games and information were displayed and presented to the client as an interactive presentation in which the client was able to participate and have a direct view upon the concept and functionality.</p>
